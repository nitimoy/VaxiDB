VaxiDB: Potential Antigens and Vaccine Candidate Database

VaxiDB is a freely available database that provides detailed information about predicted potential vaccine candidates. Our database includes information on highly probable, probable, and experimentally reported antigens.

Pathogens often have hundreds or even thousands of proteins, but only a select few are reported as antigens or vaccine candidates. In the era of bioinformatics, we leverage advanced tools to predict potential vaccine candidates against various pathogens. Notably, some of these predicted antigens have been experimentally validated. However, many proteins have never been reported as vaccine candidates, presenting opportunities for novel vaccine development.

Users can explore these novel candidates to develop efficient and innovative vaccines against different pathogens. The antigens listed as highly probable, probable, and/or experimentally reported can be used for:
* Development of recombinant proteins
* Immunoassays
* Diagnostic kits
* Monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy
* Other research purposes
